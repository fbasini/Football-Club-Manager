# Football Club Manager

FootballClubManager is a **Web App** for managing football club members.

The application was created using **ASP.NET** with **WebForms** to build the user interface and **CSS** for styling and a better visual experience.

I used a **multilayered architecture** approach to improve maintainability and scalability.

For the backend, I implemented the business logic in **C#** with **.NETFramework**, which allowed us to efficiently manage the application's operations.

Data is stored in a **SQL Server** database, where **stored procedures** were used to optimize data access and **CRUD** operations.

Version control for the project was handled using **Git**, facilitating collaborative work and tracking changes in the source code.
